# InventrIO_DayZero
Compilation of the code from the lessons and some of my experiments based off of that, check out the course: https://inventr.io/courses/adventure-kit-2-day-0/

Some general notes on the pins for the MEGA 2560
 * Skip: A0-A15 (save for Analog),
 *       D0/D1 (used by USB and Serial)
 *       D14-D19 (used by Serial 1-3)
 *       D2/D3, D18-D21 (used for external interrupts)
 *       D13 (this pin controls the build in LED on the HERO XL board (LED_BUILTIN)),
 *       D2-D13, D44-D46 (used for Pulse Width Modulation (PWM))
 *       D50 (MISO), D51 (MOSI), D52 (SCK), D53 (SS).  (used for SPI communication)
 *       D20 (SDA), D21 (SCL).  (used for I2C communication using the Wire library)
 * Recommended for fewest conflicts:
 *    D22-D49
